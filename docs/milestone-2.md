## Technical Priorities

### Must-Have Features
- ✅ AR camera access and marker placement
- ✅ Message creation and storage on Arkiv
- ✅ Message discovery via geolocation
- ✅ Time-based expiration
- ✅ Wallet connection

### Nice-to-Have Features
- Message reactions/interactions
- Message sharing between users
- Advanced filtering and search
- Message analytics dashboard
- Social features (following, favorites)

### Future Considerations (Post-Milestone 2)
- Multi-chain support
- Advanced AR features (3D objects, animations)
- Community moderation tools
- Monetization options
- API for third-party integrations

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Message creation success rate > 95%
- AR marker detection accuracy > 90%
- Average message load time < 2 seconds
- Mobile compatibility across major browsers

### User Metrics
- Beta user signups: 50+ users
- Messages created: 200+ messages
- Active discovery sessions: 100+ per week
- User retention: 40% weekly active users

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AR compatibility**: Focus on WebXR standard, provide fallbacks
- **Geolocation accuracy**: Use multiple positioning methods, allow manual adjustment
- **Network latency**: Implement caching, optimize payload sizes
- **Storage costs**: Monitor Arkiv Network usage, optimize data structure

### Product Risks
- **User adoption**: Start with focused use cases, gather early feedback
- **Content moderation**: Implement basic reporting, plan for community moderation
- **Privacy concerns**: Clear privacy policy, transparent data handling

---

## Resources Needed

### Development
- Polkadot.js SDK integration
- Arkiv Network SDK and documentation
- WebXR/AR libraries and tools
- Testing infrastructure

### Design
- AR interface mockups
- Mobile UI refinements
- Marketing assets creation

### Community
- Discord/Telegram moderation
- Content creation for marketing
- Beta tester recruitment

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Focus Area | Key Deliverables |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1-2 | Core Functionality | AR camera, Arkiv integration, auth |
| 3-4 | Feature Enhancement | Message system, UI polish, mobile |
| 5 | Testing & QA | Testing, bug fixes, documentation |
| 6 | Marketing & Launch | Marketing materials, community, beta prep |

---

## Notes

- **Realistic scope**: Focus on core functionality first, polish later
- **Iterative approach**: Weekly demos and feedback loops
- **Community-driven**: Early user feedback shapes priorities
- **Quality over speed**: Better to have fewer, polished features than many broken ones

---

**Next Steps**: Begin Week 1-2 development cycle with AR camera integration and Arkiv Network connection.
