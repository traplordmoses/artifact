- API for third-party integrations

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Message creation success rate > 95%
- AR marker detection accuracy > 90%
- Average message load time < 2 seconds
- Mobile compatibility across major browsers

### User Metrics
- Beta user signups: 50+ users
- Messages created: 200+ messages
- Active discovery sessions: 100+ per week
- User retention: 40% weekly active users

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AR compatibility**: Focus on WebXR standard, provide fallbacks
- **Geolocation accuracy**: Use multiple positioning methods, allow manual adjustment
- **Network latency**: Implement caching, optimize payload sizes
- **Storage costs**: Monitor Arkiv Network usage, optimize data structure

### Product Risks
- **User adoption**: Start with focused use cases, gather early feedback
- **Content moderation**: Implement basic reporting, plan for community moderation
- **Privacy concerns**: Clear privacy policy, transparent data handling
