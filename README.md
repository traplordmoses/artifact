ARtefact

Every place has a story… share yours.

ARtefact is a location-bound AR messaging platform that turns public spaces into living layers of shared memories, notes, and discoveries. Using only a browser, users can drop time-limited, geo-anchored messages that others can uncover through their camera.

What is ARtefact?

ARtefact blends augmented reality, geolocation, and decentralized storage to let people leave digital artefacts in physical space. Messages become part of a place—waiting for someone to walk into the spot and reveal them.

With ARtefact, the world becomes a canvas of stories.
